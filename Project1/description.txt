Canny Edge Detector:

The canny edge detector follows four key steps:

1. Image smoothing
2. Computes smoothed gradients
3. Non-maximum suppression
4. Thresholding

1. Image Smoothing
The purpose of image smoothing is to reduce noise in the image so that the edge detector can differentiate between actual edges
random specks etc. The first step is to convert the 3-color channel image into a 2-dimensional array of luminence intensities. I
completed this process manually by iterating through every pixel in the image and running it through a standard conversion function.
Now that we have the image in a useable format I convolve it with a 3*3 gaussian kernel.

2. Computing Smoothed Gradients
Now that the noise in the image has been removed or at least reduced we can proceed to actually distinguishing the changes of intensity
that represent edges.
